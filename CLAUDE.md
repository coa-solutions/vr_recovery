# VR Recovery CLI

CLI tool for VR Recovery case management and operations.

## Vercel Deployment

This repo is likely running under Claude Code on a feature branch. The `VERCEL_TOKEN` environment variable is available to query connected website projects and deployments.

Use the token to:
- Check if there's a PR preview deployment connected to the current branch
- List connected Vercel projects
- View deployment status and URLs

**Note:** If the user asks for "the URL", they are very likely asking for the Vercel preview URL for the current branch.
