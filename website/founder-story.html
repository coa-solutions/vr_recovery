                                    I grew up in an alcoholic family. By my teenage years, I was deep into drugs and alcohol—using anything I could get my hands on to escape the pain. At 19, I hit rock bottom. My family intervened, and I spent three months at a rehabilitation center.

                                    I got help because I had access: a family that could intervene, a treatment center within driving distance, and the financial means to afford care. <strong>But I've watched thousands—especially veterans—who didn't have those advantages. They suffered in silence. Many died.</strong>

                                    Recovery gave me my life back. I went to medical school, earned my MD and PhD, and spent over 20 years as a Principal Investigator at NIH. I became a USPHS Commissioned Officer—essentially serving alongside the military.
                                </p>

                                    During my NIH career, I developed medical devices, published genomics research, and trained scientists. But throughout all of it, I stayed deeply involved in recovery communities—sponsoring others, volunteering, learning from both medical and self-help worlds.

                                    Over decades, I noticed: <strong>medical community, psychological therapists, and self-help groups often operated in silos.</strong> Some dismissed each other entirely.

                                    But people who thrived? They used <em>everything</em>: medical science to understand their brain, therapy to process trauma, peer support for accountability, family healing to rebuild relationships.

                                    I've lost count of people who died from addiction—not because treatment doesn't work, but because they couldn't access it. The veteran 50 miles from a VA facility. The soldier who feared career consequences. The mother who couldn't afford childcare.
